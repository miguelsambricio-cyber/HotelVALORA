## Vercel

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Hosting / Edge runtime |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes |
| Working? | Yes — every commit deploys cleanly |
| Production ready? | Yes |
| Partially implemented? | No |
| Frontend connected? | Yes (apps/web at root `apps/web`) |
| Backend connected? | N/A (FastAPI is dev-only) |
| Env vars added? | Yes (Mapbox + Resend + Supabase) |
| Vercel configured? | Yes — project `hotelvalora`, scope `miguel-sambricio-s-projects` |
| GitHub safe? | Yes — connected via `vercel git connect`; auto-deploy on push (`main` → production, branches → preview). Commit status checks post back on every PR/commit |
| Documentation complete? | Yes (`docs/deployment.md`, `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`) |
| Local tested? | Yes (`pnpm build`) |
| Production tested? | Yes (`hotelvalora.com` live) |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | Custom domain wired. No GitHub auto-deploy — `vercel deploy --prod --yes` is the canonical promotion path |

## GitHub

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | VCS |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes |
| Working? | Yes |
| Production ready? | Yes |
| Frontend connected? | N/A |
| Backend connected? | N/A |
| Env vars added? | N/A |
| Vercel configured? | Not linked for auto-deploy (intentional) |
| GitHub safe? | Yes — `.env.local` git-ignored, secrets verified out of commits |
| Documentation complete? | Yes |
| Local tested? | Yes |
| Production tested? | Yes |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | Single branch `main`. No PR workflow yet (solo dev) |

## Mapbox

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Maps |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes |
| Working? | Yes — CompSet + Market Overview maps render |
| Production ready? | Yes |
| Partially implemented? | Yes — `/library/*` map uses a static grayscale placeholder, not Mapbox |
| Frontend connected? | Yes |
| Backend connected? | N/A |
| Env vars added? | Yes — `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` set in Vercel |
| Vercel configured? | Yes |
| GitHub safe? | Yes (public token, domain-restricted on Mapbox side) |
| Documentation complete? | Yes (`docs/maps.md`, `docs/architecture/map-engine.md`) |
| Local tested? | Yes |
| Production tested? | Yes |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | Library map swap planned for Phase 4 (`docs/roadmap/master-roadmap.md`) |

## Supabase

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Database + Storage + (future) Auth |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes — project provisioned, env wired, schema + Storage buckets applied (32 tables · 5 buckets · RLS everywhere · 4 migrations registered) |
| Working? | Env probe (`/dev/supabase-test`) returns green; schema + Storage live, typed helpers in place, no app reads yet |
| Production ready? | Yes for DDL + Storage; Auth still pending |
| Partially implemented? | Yes (Supabase Auth still outstanding; Auth.js owns identity today) |
| Frontend connected? | Yes (`lib/supabase/*` clients + middleware refresh + storage helpers + generated `Database` types) |
| Backend connected? | N/A (Supabase IS the backend) |
| Env vars added? | Yes (URL + anon + service-role on Vercel) |
| Vercel configured? | Yes |
| GitHub safe? | Yes (`.env.local` ignored; placeholders in `.env.example`) |
| Documentation complete? | Yes (`docs/integrations/supabase.md`, `docs/database/README.md`, `docs/database/migrations/*.sql`) |
| Local tested? | Probe page yes; queries no |
| Production tested? | Probe page yes; queries no |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | Migrations `0001`–`0005` applied via Supabase MCP. Library surfaces production-backed via TanStack Query hooks + adapter. Next: swap mock auth to Supabase Auth / Auth.js adapter and add `postgres_changes` realtime invalidation |

## Supabase Auth (production auth runtime)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Auth runtime |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes — Supabase Dashboard wiring complete, env flags on Vercel (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED=true`), production deployed |
| Working? | Yes — Google OAuth flow round-trips through Supabase, sessions persist, `useAuth()` hydrates real user. `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` intentionally empty during Public Beta so no route redirects anonymous traffic |
| Production ready? | Yes |
| Partially implemented? | No (route protection deferred by design until private features land) |
| Frontend connected? | Yes (`useAuth()` · `useOAuth().signInWithProvider` · `AuthCard.signIn` · `/login` page · `/auth/callback`) |
| Backend connected? | Supabase Auth (`auth.users` → `handle_new_user` trigger → `public.users` + `profiles`) |
| Env vars added? | `AUTH_ENABLED=true` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED=true` on Vercel production |
| Vercel configured? | Yes — verified by `vercel env ls production` + production deploy `dpl_GcD2jM47icS8KzWDRNdYcyZY6iZF` |
| GitHub safe? | Yes (no OAuth secrets in repo — they live in Supabase Dashboard) |
| Documentation complete? | Yes (`docs/auth.md` activation checklist + Public Beta Mode section) |
| Local tested? | Typecheck + production build clean |
| Production tested? | Yes — `/auth/v1/settings` confirms Google enabled; `/auth/callback` route exchanges codes; anonymous surfaces (Library, Report) return 200 |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | Public Beta / Showcase Mode → middleware refreshes session cookie but never redirects. Re-enable protection by adding prefixes to `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` in `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` when private surfaces land |

## Google OAuth

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | OAuth identity provider |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | OAuth client `1023396989060-…apps.googleusercontent.com` created in Google Cloud Console with redirect URI `https://twebgqutuqgonabvhzjk.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. Credentials pasted into Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Providers → Google |
| Working? | Yes — `/auth/v1/settings` returns `"google": true`; Supabase URL allowlist includes `https://www.hotelvalora.com/auth/callback` + localhost + Vercel preview wildcard |
| Production ready? | Yes |
| Frontend connected? | Yes (LinkedInstitutionalAccounts surface · Google button calls `signInWithProvider("google")`) |
| Backend connected? | Supabase Auth handles the OAuth dance server-side |
| Env vars added? | None on Vercel — credentials live inside Supabase Dashboard |
| Vercel configured? | Not needed for credentials |
| Blockers | None |
| Notes | OAuth consent screen status: Testing (test users restricted). To open to all Google users, submit for verification in Google Cloud Console |
| Notes | OpenID Connect scope set: `openid profile email` |

## LinkedIn OAuth

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | OAuth identity provider |
| Status | 🔴 |
| Configured? | Provider wired; no credentials |
| Blockers | Create app at `linkedin.com/developers/apps` |
| Notes | Authorized redirect URI: `https://www.hotelvalora.com/api/auth/callback/linkedin` |

## Apple OAuth

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | OAuth identity provider |
| Status | 🔴 |
| Configured? | Provider wired; no credentials |
| Blockers | Requires Apple Developer Account (paid $99/yr) + Service ID + .p8 key |
| Notes | Auth.js mints the short-lived client_secret JWT from the .p8 key at runtime |

## Resend

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Transactional email |
| Status | 🟢 |
| Configured? | Yes |
| Working? | Yes — server action `sendTourRequestAction` sends in prod |
| Production ready? | Yes (with sandbox sender limitation) |
| Partially implemented? | Yes — sandbox sender only delivers to Resend account owner |
| Frontend connected? | Yes (Library ContactCell "Schedule a Tour" CTA) |
| Backend connected? | Yes (server action via Resend SDK) |
| Env vars added? | Yes — `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` set on Vercel |
| GitHub safe? | Yes (key only in `.env.local` + Vercel encrypted) |
| Documentation complete? | Yes (`docs/integrations/resend.md`) |
| Local tested? | Yes |
| Production tested? | Yes |
| Blockers | Sandbox sender — to deliver to arbitrary recipients, verify a domain at https://resend.com/domains |
| Notes | API key was posted in chat once — see `security-audit.md` for rotation guidance |

## OpenAI / Anthropic / Vercel AI Gateway

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | AI / LLM |

| Working? | Yes locally; only `/review` consumed from frontend |
| Production ready? | No — not deployed |
| Frontend connected? | Partial — review queue only |
| Backend connected? | Postgres + Redis via Docker Compose |
| Env vars added? | Yes (`apps/api/app/config.py` reads env) |
| Vercel configured? | N/A — FastAPI lives on its own host |
